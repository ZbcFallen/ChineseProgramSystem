# program system base on knowledge graph and Chinese text feature

## purpose of system
1st. Chinese language program. System can allow chinese program.</br>
2nd. Mutiple program language translate. No only base on chinese language, but also can translate program to other language. Like python, java and C/C++.</br>
3td. Amend the program language error. Auto amend the program language grammar error.</br>
4th. Simple program auto writing. Simple or short program can be writing by itself.</br>

## existent research statement
### Chinese research
&ensp;&ensp;In 2021, HuaWei Corporation showing a program language project which name 'CangJie'(仓颉). CangJie is a chinese program language. But up to now, there is still no public release. Therefore, it can be found that the current domestic research and progress in Chinese programming is not very successful. The CangJie language was design for program the application for the Harmony OS.

<p align="center">Figure 1.Description of Cangjie language project</p>
&ensp;&ensp;On the Other side , YiYuYan is a more success project ,unlike the CangJie , the YiYuYan project was released and in ommercial operation.But in the YiYuYan , YiYuYan grammar more like Visual Basic language. In YiYuYan program compiler , it has a surface program part and a code program window. So it can program the surface and logic in the same time. However, its syntax is quite simple and function-oriented direct programming, which limits its expansion of algorithms and functions and the development of third-party libraries.<sup>[1]</sup>

&ensp;&ensp;In the terms of feature extraction of Chinese text has many research and analysis mathod. In 
Chinese text feature extraction , the fashion way is SVM and KNN mathod to catch the feature.<sup>[4]</sup> In recent years, many researcher using the BERT model to analysis and catch the text feature.<sup>[5]</sup>  
Through this way, the chinese text can be transform to a text feature and make a grammar to let the computer can understand the chinese language, so than can make chinese programming possible.

## System design
&ensp;&ensp;This system include three module. Each one has different function. First is the transformer, Sencond is the script runner, Thrid is the language transformer.</br>
&ensp;&ensp;First module is the mechanism language transformer. This module transform chinese into mechanism language or middle language( like a script ). And this module design to work by Chinese text feature extraction.
&ensp;&ensp;Sencond module is the script runner. This module execute the middle language or mechanism language which is come from the mechanism language transformer.</br>
&ensp;&ensp;Thrid module is the other language transformer. This module can transform the middle language or script into another programming language. This module work principle is the knowledge graph. By knowledge graph, the middle language can be understand to the mechanism and transform into C/C++ or Java.

## Project Creation Purpose
1. create a mathod to extract chinese text feature.
2. build a knowledge graph to transform program language.
3. upgrade the extraion mathod make the chinese text feature extraction run faster.
